The Departed - Dublin Bus travel time prediction app

Eoghan, Finnian, Ross, Shane

The work presented in this repo encompasses a web application for Dublin Bus oriented travel information. The application aims to present the user with more accurate predicted arrival times than what can be found in static timetables. Dublin bus historic data from 2018 facilitated the training of K-Nearest Neighbour models for full routes, in each direction of travel. These models were found to dynamically predict journey times with a mean absolute error of 7.5 minutes. 

The application aims to facilitate a customised user experience by providing user accounts which personalise the application according to user preference. These user accounts are not required to use the application, but enhance the functionality of many of the application's innovative features. The project is presented to the user in the form of a mobile-optimised web application and was developed over four three-week sprints using Scrum Methodology. The application is accessible at https://www.thedeparted.games (depreciated).
